* Create a seperate branch from the **master** branch before contributing anything in order to make your **local** and **origin** master branches at par with the **upstream** master branch.
* **Free PR**: no permission is needed to work on the code. Fork `master`, submit a PR and ask for reviewing. PR is the natural place for code comparison and corrections. If many contributors have something ready in a PR, we can consider opening a branch in which different people working on the same part of the application can collaborate.
